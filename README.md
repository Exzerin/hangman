# hangman
simple hangman game with a super easy, easy, medium, and hard mode (18, 12, 8, and 6 lives).
you can add a essentially infinite lives mode by setting a inifinit mode to 26 lives. but whats the fun if you can't lose?
you will have the option to continue playing the game after you lose or win without manually rerunning the code.

just copy and paste the code into a ide and hit run.
